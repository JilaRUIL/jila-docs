Documentation for installing and customising forks of the [Jila Framework](https://github.com/JilaFramework). 

Jila is an open-source framework allowing communities with endangered languages to build engaging apps that help to preserve their culture. Jila was built by Thoughtworks.

The framework has been forked to update the code to use more recent versions of the packages it requires, and includes some changes to media management. The links to the forks are :

- [backend](https://github.com/benfoley/jila-backend)
- [mobile](https://github.com/benfoley/jila-mobile)

First, [install the tools](install.md) you need to build Jila.

Jila's backend and mobile are in two repositories. Instructions to [install the backend code](get_backend.md) and [mobile code](get_mobile.md).

Here's how to [deploy the app, or test locally](deploy.md).
